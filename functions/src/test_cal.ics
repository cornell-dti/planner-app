DESCRIPTION:Using your own words\, explain Chisholm's argument for free wil
 l. In your explanation you should aim to answer the following questions. W
 hat makes Chisholm a libertarian? What makes Chisholm's view agent-causal 
 and not event-causal? When explaining Chisholm's own argument\, try to be 
 as objective as possible in reiterating his case (i.e. don’t criticize i
 t until you have fully explained what he is saying). Practice summarizing 
 his views without introducing your own opinion.\n\nOnce you have explained
  Chisholm's argument\, you should explain whether or not you believe his a
 rgument succeeds. If it does not\, give counterarguments to show the probl
 ems with his account. If it does\, explain why ostensible counterarguments
  fail to disprove his claims.\n\n (3 Pages)
