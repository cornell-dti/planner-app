run python scripts with "python (insert file name).py"

In order to run these scripts, you need to download a private key from the firebase console. Go to the firebase console for samwise-dev and navigate to Project Settings. Then navigate to service accounts and click generate new private key. Rename this file to "firebaseadmin.json" and place it in the admin-scripts folder.
